# Modding with ThunderKit

ThunderKit is a Unity plugin that allows for a Unity Editor focussed approach to making mods for Unity games. So rather than having to build absolutely everything in code, via Visual Studio or Rider or whatever, you're able to develop a number of features of your mod directly in the Unity Editor - following a very similar workflow, and offering similar tools, as the original developers of the game would have used.

ThunderKit is not for the faint hearted, and has some complex technical steps, new terminology to learn and some limitations to consider. I've found that it works well for me when developing particularly complex mods - for example, the latest versions of my Pet mods are now built using ThunderKit.

The pages in this section give you a step by step guide to setting up ThunkderKit for Subnautica and Below Zero modding, and some hints and tips on things you can do with this excellent tool.
