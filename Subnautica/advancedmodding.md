# Advanced modding

There is so much more to modding games than I've covered so far, and if you want to make some crazy mods, you'll have to delve a little deeper. I'm on this very journey myself right now, so I'll use this section to summarise my learnings on advanced tools and techniques "as they happen".

This is very much a "work in progress", and something I'll come back to as I progress, time permitting, so please keep coming back and see what's new.

As is the case with all the content presented here, you are welcome and encourage to contribute! You can very easily do so by visiting my [GitHub Pages repository](https://github.com/mroshaw/mroshaw.github.io) and either submitting an issue or going all out and submitting a pull request. All contributions will be considered, and I thank you in advance for supporting this guide.
