# Daft Apple Games - Unity Framework

## Introduction

The Daft Apple Games Unity Framework consists of a number of discrete packages that provide core functions that can be used as a starting point for a Unity game.

The currently supported packages are briefly described below, and more detailed information can be found in the corresponding sub-section of this documentation site.

### Packages

#### Daft Apple Core

This package provides shared classes and code used by the main packages. The intention is to avoid duplicating code, maintaining consistent and clean code, and allowing all packages to benefit from core changes, fixes and innovations.

#### HDRP Time and Weather

The HDRP Time and Weather package provides a number of components that delivers stunning skies and "time of day" functionality using the out of the box components and capabilities of the High Definition Render Pipeline. As well as time of day and lighting controls, the package includes customisable weather and weather particle effects.

#### Building Tools

This package provides editor tools and run-time components to allow quick, consistent configuration of building assets in a Unity project. This includes setting up efficient and effective lighting, alignment of props with the terrain, automatically adding working doors, and mesh optimisation. The package comes with pre-sets and examples for configuring the excellent 3D Forge village assets. Third party assets are not required to use this package, however.

#### Third Person Character Controller

The TPC Controller package provides extensions to the excellent Easy Character Movement 2 package. As such, you do have to own ECM2 in order to use this package. It provides additional functionality such as a solid Third Person Character setup using Cinemachine, a complete animation framework built using blend trees, roll and sprint mechanics. A key benefit of the package is the inclusion of a behavioural AI solution using the Unity "Behaviour" package, with preconfigured behaviour trees for civilian, animal and enemy AIs.

#### Settings and UI

This package delivers a very easy to use, extendable API to quickly add configuration settings to your game. It comes with preconfigured setup for common display, performance, and audio settings, along with base classes to allow you to quickly add more. It also comes with a "themeable" UI framework, allowing you to quickly set up and apply consistent graphic and audio elements across your entire UI.
